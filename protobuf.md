## IDL

Interface Definition Language (IDL) or interface description language is a
generic term for a language that lets a program or object written in one
language communicate with another program written in an unknown language.
IDLs are usually used to describe data types and interfaces in a
language-independent way, for example, between those written in C++
and those written in Java. [Source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interface_description_language)
